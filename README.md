1. I will make 2 classes:
class player and class teammate
class teammate extends player 
2. function listPeopleChoices() which generate the list of people signed up for the league
3. use .map() to create list elements and   assign a "make player button"on list element and then addeventlistener("click") to the button so when clicked it will call the function "make player"
4. make player from class "player"
5. li.appendChild(document.createTextNode to display the list of players
6. function make player () used to generate list of players from the list of people and display as "li" element by getElementeById("player") and creating 'Li' element
7. make teammate from class teammate
8. li.appendChild(document.createTextNode to display the list of each team teammate
9. add 2 buttons "blueTeam',and 'redteam' to each of the list of player and add eventlestener "click" on each button
which when clicked will call another function makeTeammate() and add player to the team(click blueteam button to add to blue team and redteambutton to add to redteam)
10. use listElement.removeChild(li) to remove element from the list when clicked
